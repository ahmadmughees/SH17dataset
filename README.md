## **Abstract**

Workplace accidents continue to pose significant risks for human safety, particularly in industries such as construction and manufacturing, and the necessity for effective Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) compliance has become increasingly paramount. Our research focuses on the development of non-invasive techniques based on the Object Detection (OD) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and verify the proper use of various types of PPE such as helmets, safety glasses, masks, and protective clothing. This study proposes the SH17 Dataset, consisting of 8,099 annotated images containing 75,994 instances of 17 classes collected from diverse industrial environments, to train and validate the OD models. We have trained state-of-the-art OD models for benchmarking, and initial results demonstrate promising accuracy levels with You Only Look Once (YOLO)v9-e model variant exceeding 70.9% in PPE detection. The performance of the model validation on cross-domain datasets suggests that integrating these technologies can significantly improve safety management systems, providing a scalable and efficient solution for industries striving to meet human safety regulations and protect their workforce.

## Models

We have used [ultralytics==8.0.38](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) repository for training of all the yolo models. We provide trained weights for evaluation and benchmarking purposes for yolo v8, v9, and v10 object detection models.

you can install ultralytics using `pip install ultralytics=8.0.38` 
and weights can be downloaded by clicking model in the table below or from the [releases section](https://github.com/ahmadmughees/SH17dataset/releases).

## Update train_files.txt and test_files.txt

The `train_files.txt` and `test_files.txt` with the dataset contains only list of images while in the YOLO format it needs full image path, so append the full path within each file. You can use [update_train_test_files.py](data/update_train_test_files.py) script to achieve that. 
After that your files should have the structure as below,
```
\full\path\to\images\pexels-photo-11739107.jpeg
\full\path\to\images\pexels-photo-6766248.jpeg
\full\path\to\images\pexels-photo-7674606.jpeg
\full\path\to\images\pexels-photo-7222236.jpeg
\full\path\to\images\pexels-photo-8837596.jpeg
...
```

## Usage
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO(r"\path\to\weight.pt")  # provide path to the trained model 
results = model('path\of\image')  # Run inference

results.show()  # View results
```
For more usage details please refer to [ultralytics docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/).

## Evaluation

We provide evaluation code to reproduce our benchmark results on the SH17 validation set.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO(r"\path\to\weight.pt")
model.val(data="sh17.yaml", batch = 1, imgsz = 640, device="cuda:0")
```
